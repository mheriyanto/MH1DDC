# MH1DDC
MH1DDC is inversion software using Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of one-dimension DC resistivity using in MATLAB.

These were scripts that were used to implement our proceeding paper:
M. Heriyanto and W. Srigutomo. 1-D DC resistivity inversion using singular value decomposition and Levenberg-Marquardt inversion schemes. Journal of Physics: Conference Series 877 (2017) 012066. doi:10.1088/1742-6596/877/1/012066. ([pdf](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/877/1/012066/pdf)). I presented this paper on International Conference on Energy Sciences 2016. July 27, 2016. ([slide](https://figshare.com/articles/1-D_DC_Resistivity_Inversion_Using_Singular_Value_Decomposition_and_Levenberg-Marquardt_s_Inversion_Schemes/4644637)). These scripts contain three main scripts: forward, LM, and SVD inversion. 

I hope these scripts can help students to enter research on geophysical inversion. 
Any updates about these scripts can be seen in [my blog](https://mheriyanto.wordpress.com/mh1ddc/).
